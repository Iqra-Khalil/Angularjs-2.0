# ng-book 2: Simple Reddit-like App

**Note:** The example app from [ng-book 2][] has been refactored into
multiple files.

> A simple voting app that resembles a minimal-reddit link voting app in
> Angular 2.

## Dependencies

Before you get started, you need to make sure you have node.js
installed. We'll be using `npm` to run this project (`npm` will be
installed when you install node.js). You can [install node.js
here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Installing

First, you need to make sure you install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then we will

- compile our TypeScript code and
- host the app on local development server

by running the command:

```
npm run go
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your
browser. You should see an application with the header `Angular 2 Simple
Reddit`.

## Getting Help

In the case where it doesn't work, the first thing to try is looking at
the developer console in your browser.

If that doesn't work, [come chat with
